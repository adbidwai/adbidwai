### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an ECE undegraduate student from BITS-PILANI University (Goa Campus). 

My research interests lie in embedded systems, robotics and autonomous navigation, especially control of mobile robots. 

Currently researching on geometric control for complex maneuevers and agile exploration of quadrotors.

I am also diving into the perception side of robotics and researching on different exploration strategies for active VSLAM.
