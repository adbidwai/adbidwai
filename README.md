### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work as a research engineer at the Multi Agent Robotic Motion (MARMot) Lab in NUS, Singapore. I graduated as a bachelor's student in ECE from BITS-Pilani, Goa campus in 2022.

My broad research interests lie in (or in the intersection of) embedded systems (I love to work with hardware :D), robotics and autonomous navigation. I am (currently) specifically more interested in the perception and control domains of mobile robotics. Looking forward to also get into learning methods for autonomous navigation, like end-to-end learning and reinforcement learning.

Currently researching on geometric control for complex maneuevers and agile exploration of quadrotors.

I am also diving into the perception side of robotics and researching on different exploration strategies for active VSLAM.
